## Inspiration

My challenges used to be at multiple places at once, so I thought that making one central website for all of my challenges would be best.

## Challenges

Nothing too difficult about this website.

## The Website

Very basic Bootstrap layout with links to all of my Frontend Mentor challenges.

## Lessons Learned

Nothing learned here.
