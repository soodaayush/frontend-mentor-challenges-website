![frontend-mentor-challenges-website](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d985e426-2738-4719-9d98-2e92ea6af9ef)

## Inspiration

This is a simple hub that showcases all of my completed Frontend Mentor challenges. I created it to keep everything in one place instead of scattered across folders and repositories.

## Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness
- Deployed with Netlify

## The Website

The site features a clean and minimal Bootstrap-based layout, with clickable cards linking to each of my individual challenge solutions. It’s straightforward and easy to navigate.

## Lessons Learned

This was more of an organizational task than a technical one, so there weren’t many new concepts learned. That said, it was a good reminder that a little structure goes a long way in keeping projects manageable.
